insightip
=========

Hello, world. 
---------

I committed some code tonight (2013-05-13), but don't you dare criticize my mid 1990s era PHP code. The stuff I'm putting in here is just to prove out the data model and make sure everything is going to display as intended. 


Getting started
---------

Just make sure you've got a LAMP or WAMP or xAMP stack available. This thing installs a lot like Wordpress. Just unpack the files into a webserver, and hit the URL. It should be smart enough to redirect you to a setup page. That's something I built into the very first working checkin because I think it's super important to have an easy setup.

Import usage note
---------
If you download this version of the project, keep in mind that it expects to run off the root path.

`http://localhost:8080/` **works**

`http://localhost:8080/insightip` **doesn't work**

For now anyway
